# Campus Event Scheduling System
Project Overview

This system is designed to manage campus resources (rooms/halls) and schedule events with intelligent conflict resolution. Unlike a simple calendar, this tool uses an **Interval Tree** to detect time clashes in  time and supports **Priority-Based Preemption**, allowing high-priority events to automatically displace lower-priority ones.

## 🛠 Core Features

* **Interval Tree Search:** Specialized data structure for fast overlap detection.
* **Priority Preemption:** Automatic rescheduling of "bumped" events into the next available 15-minute gap.
* **Registration Management:** FIFO-based participant queues with automated waitlist promotion.
* **Undo/Redo System:** Stack-based management of scheduling actions.
* **Utilization Analytics:** Generates reports on room usage percentages and date-specific density.
* **Persistent Storage:** Save and load system states via `campus_data.txt`.

Data Structure Design

The system is built upon three primary pillars:

1. **Interval Tree (Search Model):** Each room maintains an Interval Tree. Nodes are sorted by `startMinutes`, but also store a `maxEnd` value. This allows the search algorithm to prune entire subtrees that cannot possibly contain an overlap.
2. **Participant Queues (Queue Model):**
Uses `std::queue` to maintain fairness. If a participant withdraws from a full event, the system automatically migrates the front of the waitlist to the registered list.
3. **Resource Map (Hash Model):**
Uses `std::unordered_map` for  lookup of room objects via their `ResourceID`.

Complexity Analysis & Performance

| Operation | Data Structure | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Search for Conflict** | Interval Tree |  |
| **Insert Event** | Interval Tree |  |
| **Undo/Redo** | Stack |  |
| **Room Lookup** | Unordered Map |  |
| **Waitlist Promotion** | Queue |  |

Test Cases (Validation)

| Test Category | Input Action | Expected Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Conflict Detection** | Book 10:00-11:00 over 10:30-11:30 | System rejects or triggers preemption. | PASSED |
| **Preemption** | Priority 3 Event over Priority 1 Event | Priority 1 Event is moved to next free slot. | PASSED |
| **Queue Overflow** | Add 11th person to 10-cap room | Participant moved to waitlist. | PASSED |
| **Persistence** | Save data, Restart, Load data | All events and queues restored exactly. | PASSED |

## 💻 Installation & Usage
```

### File Structure

* `main.cpp`: User interface and menu loop.
* `Scheduler.h/cpp`: Business logic, preemption, and file I/O.
* `IntervalTree.h`: Wrapper for the tree structure.
* `IntervalTreeNode.h/cpp`: Low-level tree nodes and search logic.
* `Event.h`: Data structures for Events and Participants.

* **Why an Interval Tree?** "Because a sorted list is  to search for overlaps, whereas an Interval Tree allows us to skip branches, making it ."
* **How does Preemption work?** "We identify all clashing events. If the new event has a strictly higher priority, we remove the old ones, insert the new one, and then use a `findGap` algorithm to relocate the old events."
* **How is memory managed?** "We use a `vector<Event*> ownedEvents` to track all heap-allocated events, ensuring they are deleted in the `~Scheduler` destructor to prevent memory leaks."
